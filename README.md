# About The Project

This project is a modular and scalable backend API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It follows RESTful principles and is structured with a focus on clean architecture and maintainability.

Designed for both learning and real-world usage, the project provides a solid foundation for developing modern web or mobile applications. Its structure allows easy extension for user management, authentication, and role-based access control.

It is ideal for:
- Web applications built with React, Angular, or Vue
- Mobile applications using React Native or Flutter
- Backend services requiring fast and reliable data operations

## üîß Key Features

- **Clean and Modular Codebase**: Project structure follows separation of concerns, making it easy to navigate, maintain, and scale as requirements grow.
- **Built with JavaScript & Express**: Focuses on simplicity while leveraging the power of Node.js for non-blocking, high-performance APIs.
- **MongoDB with Mongoose**: Uses Mongoose to model application data, ensuring schema consistency and simplifying database interactions.
- **Centralized Error & Response Handling**: Common patterns for sending responses and catching errors across routes and services.
- **Logging System**: Integrated logging for monitoring requests, responses, and errors using middleware ‚Äî useful for debugging and observability.
- **Async/Await for Non-Blocking Operations**: All async operations are handled using async/await for cleaner and more readable code.
- **Docker Support**: Dockerfile included for seamless containerization and environment consistency during deployment.
- **Scalable Backend API**: Designed to serve multiple frontends (web or mobile) independently, with no direct coupling to any UI layer.
- **Ready for Production Use**: Includes best practices such as environment configuration, modular routing, and middleware usage.

> This backend can easily be extended to support authentication, authorization, caching (Redis), file upload, rate limiting, and more based on project needs.

## üì° Server-Sent Events ‚Äì One-Way Messaging

Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow a web page to automatically receive updates from the server over a single, long-lived HTTP connection.

Unlike traditional methods where the client repeatedly requests data, SSE enables the server to **push updates automatically** to the client.

**Common use cases include:**  
Facebook/Twitter updates, stock market updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.

## üîê Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
This project includes a role-based authorization mechanism to control access to protected resources. After a user logs in and receives a valid JWT token, the system checks both the user's identity and their assigned roles before allowing access to specific endpoints.

Key steps:

- The client sends a request with a JWT token in the Authorization header.

- The server authenticates the user and extracts role data.

- Role middleware verifies if the user has the necessary permissions.

- If authorized, the API executes the database operation and returns the result.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design ‚Äì MongoDB (NoSQL)

This project uses MongoDB with a well-structured, relational-like schema using references and embedded relationships to manage users, roles, and permissions.

Key Collections:

- Users: Stores user profile and login information.

- Roles: Defines user access roles (e.g., Admin, Editor).

- User_Roles: Manages many-to-many relationships between users and roles.

- Role_Privileges: Defines specific permissions per role.

- AuditLogs: Tracks user actions for transparency and debugging.

- Categories: Sample content-type collection linked to user actions.

- The model supports a flexible and scalable role-based access system, and is ideal for multi-user applications requiring fine-grained authorization.

## üîë Authentication Flow (JWT Based)

This project uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless authentication between client and server.

Flow Overview:

- The client sends a request with a JWT token in the Authorization header.

- The server verifies the token using authentication middleware.

- If the token is valid, user identity is confirmed.

- Authenticated users can access protected endpoints, which interact with the database.

- A response is returned based on the database query result.

- This flow ensures secure and scalable authentication without needing to store session data on the server.

 ## JavaScript Destructuring Assignment

 This project makes extensive use of Destructuring Assignment, introduced in ES6, to simplify code structure and improve readability.
*  What is Destructuring ?
   Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables in a concise way.
   
- Simplifies request parsing and object handling.

- Makes service and controller layers cleaner by extracting only needed values.

- Reduces boilerplate and improves maintainability.
  
   ```javascript 
   // Array Destructuring
  const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  
  // Object Destructuring
  const user = { id: 1, name: "Bora", role: "admin" };
  const { id, name } = user;;
    ```
 ##  How to Build and Run This Project
This project requires a running MongoDB instance and Node.js environment.
